# Starting my first ever workflowr project


# Two folders below I can't delete:

## analysis/: This directory contains all the source R Markdown files for implementing the data analyses for your project.
## docs/: This directory contains all the HTML files for your website.

## Other

## data/: This directory is for raw data files.

## code/: This directory is for code and scripts that might not be
# appropriate as R Markdown notebooks (e.g. for pre-processing the data, or for long-running code).

## output/: This directory is for processed data files and other outputs generated
# from the code and data. For example, scripts in code that pre-process raw data
# files from data/ should save the processed data files in output/.

# Building the website
wflow_build(c(
  "analysis/index.Rmd",
  "analysis/about.Rmd",

# View the website without building it first
wflow_view()

# View the status of the workflowr project
wflow_status()

#  The first argument to wflow_publish()
# is a character vector of the R Markdown files to publish.
# The second is a message that will recorded by the version control system Git when
# it commits (i.e. saves a snapshot of) these files. The more informative the commit message the
# better (so that future you knows what you were trying to accomplish).
