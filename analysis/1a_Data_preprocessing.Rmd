1a. Data preprocessing

Converting mission and aim statements documents into a table to use it in the further analysis.

# General information 
We collected in total 129 mission and aim statements of stakeholders involved in the research landscape in ecology and evolutionary biology. We identified six groups: advocates (24 documents), funders (30), journals (non Open Access = 16, journals Open Access = 14), publishers (for-profit = 7, not-for-profit = 8), repositories (17) and learned societies (13). 

# Identifying stakeholders
The stakeholders were identified in advance in various ways. 

Journals <br>
We used Scimago Journal & Country Rank website (https://www.scimagojr.com/) to search for the journals with the highest journal's impact value in 2020 (subject areas such as: Environmental Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology) that publish articles relevant for fields: ecology and evolutionary biology. We aimed to identified ~ 15 journals for both categories: only open access (OA) journals and non-open access (non-OA) journals. We included some journals that were not on the list but were identified as relevant journals by others.
We made sure that we had journals which are owned by identified by us learned societies. 

Publishers <br>
We identified publishers based on the list of our journals.

Funders <br>
We looked what funders were mentioned in "Acknowledgments" sections of some scientific articles published in 2019 and 2020 in high impact factor journals (OA and non-OA). We focused on finding funders from all continents with a limit to max. 3 per country (only when appeared frequently in Acknowledgments). Moreover, we contacted some colleges for information on the funding source in their country. 

Repositories <br>
We looked at the Data availability statements of the articles published in 2019 and 2020 in high impact factor journals (OA and non-OA) and collected information on where the data and code were archived. Our list includes generalist repositories and subject specific repositories. 

Societies <br>
We identified societies based on the journals they own and by word-of-mouth. 

Advocates <br>
Advocated is a group of organisations that actively support or promote good quality and accessible research (open research).
<br>
We have considered different aspects of open research (open access, open data, open methods) when looking for the organisations. They might support research in different than ecology and evolutionary biology discipline but should be relevant for these two as well. 

# Aims and missions statements 
In August 2021 we collected the Aims and Mission Statements on the official website of each of the stakeholder. We did not contact anyone associated with the stakeholders to request more information. If there was no separate section but the aims or missions were described in "About" section, we chose it instead. The text from these websites were manually copied and separately saved for each of the stakeholders as .txt. The first line in the documents is a source website. 

# Documents preprocessing
To be able to analyse the content of the statements we preprocessed the documents 
to create one dataset with one word per row and information about the word source and position in the text/sentence. Some irrelevant words were removed and each of the word was lemmatizationed or stemminged. We followed a cleaning process suggested in Maier et al. 2018 "Applying LDA Topic Modelling in Communication Research: Toward a Valid and Reliable Methodology".

We followed these steps:

1) Importing all documents and converting them into a table.
Columns:
  name - name of the stakeholder
  filename - name of the file (NameOfStakeholder_DocumentType)
  stakeholder - stakeholder group (here: advocates, funders, journals,for-profit publishers, not-for-profit publishers, repositories, societies)
  txt - text (Statements)
  doc_type - type of the document (Mission Statement or About)

2) Removing link formatting from the text (http:// and https:// links)
3) Separating text into sentences and keeping information what document and stakeholder they belong to.
4) Tokenisation - creating a tidy text, converting tokens to lowercase, removing punctuation, deleting special characters
5) Removing stop-words, for this we used lexicons SMART and snowball in stop_words lexicon (library tidytext) and removing other not significant words like: numbering (ii, iii, iv, v), name of document type (aim, aims, mission...), name of the stakeholders (erc, nerc, wellcome)
7) Lemmatization (library lexicon) - converting words to their lemma form/lexeme (e.g., "contaminating" and "contamination" become "contaminate") (Manning & Sch√ºtze, 2003, p. 132). 

We worked on a relatively small number of documents and because of that we did not perform relative prunning (stripping very rare and extremely frequent word occurrences from the observed data).
